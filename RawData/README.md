Here you'll find the raw data used in model creation and validation, as required to be made public by eLife.

Files with the "IClamp" designation are current-clamp recordings with the current also included in the file name. The first column is the time steps, while the second is the recorded voltage. Details on these experimental protocols can be found in the Materials and Methods of the manuscript.

Files with the "VClamp" designation are voltage-clamp recordings with the voltage also included in the file name. The first column is the time steps, while the second is the recorded current. Details on these experimental protocols can be found in the Materials and Methods of the manuscript.

The "IClamp" data is used in model creation (the optimization step) and validation (using some of the traces not included in model creation). The "VClamp" data is processed to yield the h-current kinetic data presented for the "primary cell" (in fashions described in the Materials and Methods).

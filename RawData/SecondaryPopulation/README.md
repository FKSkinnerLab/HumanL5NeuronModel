Here you will find experimental data from the "secondary" population of L5 Pyramidal Neurons, as presented in Chameh et. al. 2019 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/08/30/748988.full.pdf).

We include the files necessary to generate the experimental FDG plots shown in Figure 11, as well as the example ZAP current plot shown in Figure 7.

We note that there are two other parts of the paper where experimental data from Chameh et. al. is included in the manuscript: Table 1 and Figure 6. The data in Table 1 is all that was used in the modeling process (i.e. no specific spiking characteristics from a single secondary cell were fitted to), and the data from secondary cells in Figure 6 is presented primarily to provide a "context" of the features of this class of cell more generally (and thus would not be involved in any "replication" or "reproduction" of any of the work presented in this manuscript).

If further detail regarding the data presented in Chameh et. al. is desired, they will be made available upon reasonable request via contact with the authors.

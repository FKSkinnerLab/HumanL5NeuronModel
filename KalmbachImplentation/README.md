# HumanL5NeuronModel
Code associated with the publication, "A novel human neuron model reveals the influence of inter-species h-channel kinetic differences on resonant responses"

This code can be used to implement the model presented by Kalmbach et. al. 2018 and apply the relevant in silico experiments performed in our research.

The model can also be found as part of  https://github.com/AllenInstitute/human_neuron_Ih

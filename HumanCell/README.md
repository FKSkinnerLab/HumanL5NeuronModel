# HumanL5NeuronModel
Code associated with the publication, "A novel human neuron model reveals the influence of inter-species h-channel kinetic differences on resonant responses"

Here we present the NEURON code for implementation of the human L5 cortical pyramidal cell model, as well as vairous procedures to perform relevant in silico experiments and manipulations.

To initialize the model, run the init_final.hoc file. The variety of in silico experiments that were performed on the model are found in the DefineProcs.hoc file. The parameter values defining the model are found in the L5_params_exponential.hoc file. The novel human h-current model is the Ih.mod file.

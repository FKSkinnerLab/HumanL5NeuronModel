# HumanL5NeuronModel
Code associated with the publication, "A novel human neuron model reveals the influence of inter-species h-channel kinetic differences on resonant responses"

Here we present the NEURON code for implementation of the human L5 cortical pyramidal cell model, as well as vairous procedures to perform relevant in silico experiments and manipulations.

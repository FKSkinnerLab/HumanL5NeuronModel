# HumanL5NeuronModel
Code associated with the publication, "A novel human neuron model reveals the influence of inter-species h-channel kinetic differences on resonant responses"

In this subfolder, you will find relevant NEURON code to implement the model of Hay et. al. 2011, as well as apply the in silico experiments performed in this work.

These pieces of code should be used in concert with the full presentation of the Hay model, which can be found on ModelDB (Accession:139653)
